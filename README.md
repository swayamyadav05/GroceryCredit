# GroceryCredit

## üí° Personal Story

One day, my mom asked me to help her keep track of grocery items and the money spent, which she had been recording manually in a notebook. Wanting to make things easier and mordern for her, and to work on to build a real-world app, I created GroceryCredit. This app is dedicated to her, and to anyone who wants a simple, digital way to manage grocery credits.

## üöÄ Project Overview

GroceryCredit helps you manage and track your grocery expenses and credits efficiently. It provides a clean UI for adding, viewing, and summarizing your monthly grocery credits, with a robust backend and cloud database support.

## ‚ú® Features

-   Add, update, and delete grocery credits
-   Monthly summary and filtering
-   Responsive, modern UI (React + Vite + TailwindCSS)
-   RESTful API (Express)
-   PostgreSQL database (Neon, serverless-ready)
-   Drizzle ORM for type-safe database access and migrations

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

-   **Frontend:** React, Vite, TypeScript, TailwindCSS
-   **Backend:** Node.js, Express, TypeScript
-   **Database:** PostgreSQL (Neon, serverless-ready)
-   **ORM:** Drizzle ORM (type-safe migrations & queries)
-   **Deployment:** Vercel (CI/CD for seamless updates)

## ‚ö° Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/grocerycredit.git
cd grocerycredit
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Set Up Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the project root:

```env
POSTGRES_URL=your-neon-postgres-connection-string
DATABASE_URL=your-neon-postgres-connection-string
```

### 4. Run Database Migrations

```bash
npx drizzle-kit push
```

### 5. Start the Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

-   The backend/API will run on [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)
-   The frontend is served from the backend (or you can run Vite separately in `client/` if needed)
