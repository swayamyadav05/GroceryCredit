# LinkedIn Post: Udhaaro - A Full-Stack Journey from MongoDB to PostgreSQL

🚀 **Just deployed my latest full-stack project: Udhaaro!**

**The Story:**
My mom was manually tracking grocery credits in a notebook, so I built her a modern web app. What started as a simple request turned into a comprehensive full-stack application with some interesting technical challenges along the way.

**🛠️ Tech Stack:**
• **Frontend:** React 18 + TypeScript + Vite + TailwindCSS + shadcn/ui
• **Backend:** Node.js + Express + TypeScript
• **Database:** PostgreSQL (Neon) with Drizzle ORM
• **State Management:** TanStack Query (React Query)
• **Deployment:** Vercel (serverless functions + static hosting)

**🔥 Key Features:**
✅ Full CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
✅ Real-time data updates with optimistic UI
✅ Monthly filtering and summary statistics
✅ Responsive design with modern UI components
✅ Type-safe API with comprehensive error handling
✅ Toast notifications for user feedback

**🔄 Technical Journey:**
Started with MongoDB Atlas but faced connection issues, so I migrated to PostgreSQL with Neon. This taught me valuable lessons about database selection and migration strategies.

**🎯 What I Learned:**
• Serverless function architecture on Vercel
• Database migration from MongoDB to PostgreSQL
• Type-safe API development with Drizzle ORM
• Modern React patterns with TanStack Query
• Real-world deployment challenges and solutions

This project reinforced my belief that the best applications solve real problems. Sometimes the simplest requests lead to the most rewarding technical challenges!
